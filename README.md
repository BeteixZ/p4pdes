_PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_ is a [SIAM Press](https://www.siam.org/publications/books) book (to appear) on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to solve [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) by numerical methods.

This repository contains only the C and Python codes upon which the book is based.  They will remain here for the long term, and be maintained.

### C codes

To compile and run the example C codes see the `README.md` in the `c/` directory.

### Python/Firedrake codes

Chapter 13 uses [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/), a [Python](https://www.python.org/) finite element library based on [petsc4py](https://petsc4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  See the `README.md` in the `python/` directory.
