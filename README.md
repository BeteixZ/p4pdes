_PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_ is a [SIAM Press](https://www.siam.org/publications/books) book (to appear) on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to solve [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) by numerical methods.

This repository contains only the C and Python codes upon which the book is based.  They will remain here for the long term, and be maintained.

### C codes

To compile and run the example C codes see the `README.md` in the [`c/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/c) directory.

### Python/Firedrake codes

The codes in Chapter 13 use [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/), a finite element library based on PETSc data types and solvers.  See the `README.md` in the [`python/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/python) directory.
