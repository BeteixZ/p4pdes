_PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_ is a book on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for numerically-solving [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation).  It will be published by [SIAM Press](http://www.siam.org/books/).

This repository contains only the codes upon which the book is based.  They will remain here for the long term, and be maintained.

### The C codes

To compile and run the example C codes see `README.md` in the [`c/`](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes/tree/master/c) subdirectory.
