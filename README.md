_PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_ is a new book on using [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) to solve [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) by modern numerical methods.  It can be pre-ordered from [SIAM Press](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=32850137):

This repository contains the C and Python programs upon which the book is based.  They will remain here for the long term, and be maintained.

### C examples

To compile and run the C examples, for Chapters 1 through 12, see `README.md` in the `c/` directory.

### Python/Firedrake examples

Chapters 13 and 14 use [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/), a [Python](https://www.python.org/) finite element library based on [petsc4py](https://petsc4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  See `README.md` in the `python/` directory.
