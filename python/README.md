==============

The codes in Chapter 13 use [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/), a finite element library based on PETSc data types and solvers.  Firedrake uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [petsc4py](https://petsc4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

These codes will remain here and be maintained and supported in the long term.

### configure and install Firedrake

To download and install Firedrake installation follow the instructions at the [download tab on the Firedrake page](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html).  It is recommended that you allow Firedrake to download its own copy of PETSc.

After the initial download (of the Firedrake install script) do something like

        $ unset PYTHONPATH; unset PETSC_DIR; unset PETSC_ARCH;
        $ python3 firedrake-install

Firedrake will then proceed to download and install its rather large stack of dependencies.  The reason to unset variables is so that Firedrake does its own PETSc install with its own compatible version of PETSc.

### run the Poisson example

Do something like this to run the Poisson solver:

        $ cd p4pdes/python/ch13/
        $ source ~/firedrake/bin/activate
        (firedrake) $ ./fish.py

Use `./fish.py --help` to get some options.

The default grid is 3 x 3 and the default KSP is CG.  Note the grid can be set by either `-refine X` or `-mx` and `-my`; using `-refine` allows geometric multigrid (GMG).  Solver options use prefix `-s_`.  Thus for CG+GMG on a fine grid do something like

        (firedrake) $ ./fish.py -refine 8 -s_pc_type mg -s_ksp_monitor

To get an output file in Paraview-readable form use `-o NAME.pvd`.

### run the Stokes example

Running the Stokes solver `stokes.py` is similar.  For a uniform grid with default Taylor-Hood elements do

        (firedrake) $ ./stokes.py -mx 65 -my 65 -s_ksp_monitor

Generally the options available for `fish.py` are also available for `stokes.py`, but see `--help` output.

For a nonuniform grid, with refinement in the lower corners, use a special script to generate a `.geo` geometry-description file and then use [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) to generate a mesh readable by `stokes.py`:

        (firedrake) $ ./lidbox.py foo.geo
        (firedrake) $ gmsh -2 foo.geo
        (firedrake) $ ./stokes.py -i foo.msh -s_ksp_monitor

For more about solver options see the book text in Chapter 13.


### run the test suite

Do

        (firedrake) $ make test

### visualize results

The two codes `fish.py` and `stokes.py` allow the `-o foo.pvd` option which writes a file which is readable with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

### cleaning up

Do

        $ make clean
