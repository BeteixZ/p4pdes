Running jobs on CLUSTER
=======================

This subdirectory contains a sample batch script which runs codes from
the book _PETSc for Partial Differential Equations_.

CLUSTER is a modest-sized Linux cluster at the University of Alaska Fairbanks:

Access is generally limited to UAF students and faculty.  Thus this batch
script is _only_ an example which might be useful as a suggestion for how
PETSc codes are run in a batch system on many-node machines.
